# Data-Structures---II
Searching and Sorting 

**Resources**

Grokking Alogrithms by Aditya Bhargava is a great resource for Data Structures and Searching & Sorting Algos. Also the code is in Python here: https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-algorithms? Look for Source code. 

**Exercises**

1) Write a function that performs binarysearch

``` python
    def binarysearch(alist,item):
      # code goes here
   ```
2) Write a function that performs selectionsort

``` python
    def selectionsort(alist):
      # code goes here
  ```
      
3) Write a function that performs Quicksort . Refer to pages 51 - 73 in Grokking Algorithms. 

``` python
    def quicksort(alist):
      # code goes here
  ```
